    - RookCook is an innovative web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) that personalizes recipe suggestions    
      based on the ingredients and kitchen tools users have available. The platform leverages Firebase for user authentication, enabling seamless login and 
      profile management. It features an interactive kitchen environment, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with Docker containers to ensure      
      scalable and efficient deployment. RookCook includes an advanced ingredient management system to streamline searches, supported by a robust search and 
      filter function. Users can rate recipes, participate in discussion forums, and manage personalized profiles. Additionally, RookCook provides
      nutritional information to inform cooking choices, fostering a community-driven, efficient, and enjoyable cooking experience.

    - Restaurant Website Demo (Learning Project)
      I designed and developed a responsive restaurant website to explore frontend development concepts and user experience design. 
      This project served as a hands-on learning exercise to strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while fostering creativity in solving real-world problems.

      Key Features:
        Dynamic Menu Interface: A sidebar with food categories that displays relevant dishes upon selection, enhancing user navigation.
        Customization & Notes: Users can customize dishes (e.g., toppings, spice levels) and leave special instructions for the chef.
        Interactive Cart System: Automatically calculates total prices, supports item quantity adjustments, and allows item removal.
        Responsive Layout: Clean header with branding, intuitive dish presentation, and a footer with business hours, location, and contact details.

      Learning & Future Potential:
        While this project focuses on core frontend functionality, it lays the groundwork for more advanced integrations. For example:
          Backend/server integration to process orders in real-time.
          Secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
          User authentication, order history tracking, or reservation systems.
          
      This demo reflects my passion for iterative learning and balancing simplicity with scalability. I prioritized creating a user-friendly foundation that could evolve into a full-stack application 
      with additional features.


https://0boots.github.io/Vdayinvite/        🌹

    - A lighthearted and interactive Valentine's Day-themed web project I created to spread some fun and joy. The site features a playful invitation asking users, "Will you be my Valentine?" with two buttons to choose from: Yes or No.
    If the user clicks No, the site cheekily responds by adding more "Yes" buttons, encouraging persistence.
    If the user clicks Yes, they’re greeted with a cute and whimsical GIF on a new page.
    The project showcases my ability to create simple, engaging, and user-friendly web interactions with a humorous twist. It also highlights my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript to create interactive elements.
